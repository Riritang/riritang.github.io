  "There are two primary motivations behind the creation of this website. Firstly, it serves as a platform to share my professional journey and offer guidance to individuals embarking on their CRM careers, mirroring my own experience when I commenced my first CRM-related internship four years ago (2019). Back then, I grappled with a limited understanding of CRM roles and the trajectory of my professional path. This website aims to support newcomers in navigating the complexities of CRM, providing insights about entering this field. It is my aspiration that visitors acquire a foundational understanding of CRM, and assist them in making informed decisions.",
  "Moreover, this website serves as an extension of my one-page CV, offering a comprehensive view of my passion for CRM and my professional capabilities. Its purpose is to provide a broader scope for organizations in Europe to see my capabilities and talent.",
  "If you are an HR or CRM manager interested in exploring my expertise, please review my CV and portfolio. I’m looking for the opportunity to engage in further discussion with you.",
